## Tactile sensor simulation
This plugin can also be used to simulate tactile sensor arrays like the [Myrmex sensor](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carsten-Schuermann/publication/229035606_Modular_high_speed_tactile_sensor_system_with_video_interface/links/541affca0cf25ebee988df89/Modular-high-speed-tactile-sensor-system-with-video-interface.pdf).
